# A collection of random scripts I've written

### yt_subs_categorizer

A small Python script that accepts the subscriptions.csv file obtainable from Google Takeout and scrapes 
each channel to estimate what category of vids the channel is uploading.
I've written it cause I forgot to ever clean my subscriptions and the number got so big I didn't want to go
through it all at once.
The script is scuffed, cause I make the estimate based off the most recently uploaded video,
but that's exactly what I wanted anyway.
